<h2>Alexander the Great</h2>
<p>a] He succeeded his father Philip II to the throne in 336 BC at the age of 20, and spent most of his ruling years conducting a lengthy military campaign throughout Western Asia and Egypt . 2] He was undefeated in battle and is widely considered to be one of history's greatest and most successful military commanders. [ 3] [4] Until the age of 16, Alexander was tutored by Aristotle . 5] [6] In 334 BC, he invaded the Achaemenid Persian Empire and began a series of campaigns that lasted for 10 years. Due to the demand of his homesick troops, he eventually turned back at the Beas River and later died in 323 BC in Babylon , the city of Mesopotamia that he had planned to establish as his empire's capital. With his death marking the start of the Hellenistic period , Alexander's legacy includes the cultural diffusion and syncretism that his conquests engendered, such as Greco-Buddhism and Hellenistic Judaism . He founded more than twenty cities , with the most prominent being the city of Alexandria in Egypt. His military achievements and unprecedented enduring successes in battle made him the measure against which many later military leaders would compare themselves, [c] and his tactics remain a significant subject of study in military academies worldwide.</p>
<h2>Lineage and childhood</h2>
<p>Alexander III was born in Pella , the capital of the Kingdom of Macedon , [8] on the sixth day of the ancient Greek month of Hekatombaion , which probably corresponds to 20 July 356 BC (although the exact date is uncertain). [ 11] [Note 1] Although Philip had seven or eight wives, Olympias was his principal wife for some time, likely because she gave birth to Alexander. [ 13] According to the ancient Greek biographer Plutarch , on the eve of the consummation of her marriage to Philip, Olympias dreamed that her womb was struck by a thunderbolt that caused a flame to spread "far and wide" before dying away. Sometime after the wedding, Philip is said to have seen himself, in a dream, securing his wife's womb with a seal engraved with a lion's image. [ 14] Plutarch offered a variety of interpretations for these dreams: that Olympias was pregnant before her marriage, indicated by the sealing of her womb; or that Alexander's father was Zeus . The horse refused to be mounted, and Philip ordered it away. Macedon is too small for you", and bought the horse for him. [ 18] Alexander named it Bucephalas , meaning "ox-head".</p>
<h2>Education</h2>
<p>When Alexander was 13, Philip began to search for a tutor , and considered such academics as Isocrates and Speusippus , the latter offering to resign from his stewardship of the Academy to take up the post. In the end, Philip chose Aristotle and provided the Temple of the Nymphs at Mieza as a classroom. 20] Mieza was like a boarding school for Alexander and the children of Macedonian nobles, such as Ptolemy , Hephaistion , and Cassander . Many of these students would become his friends and future generals, and are often known as the "Companions". Aristotle taught Alexander and his companions about medicine, philosophy, morals, religion, logic, and art. 21] Alexander was able to quote Euripides from memory. [ 22] During his youth, Alexander was also acquainted with Persian exiles at the Macedonian court, who received the protection of Philip II for several years as they opposed Artaxerxes III . [ 23] [24] [25] Among them were Artabazos II and his daughter Barsine , possible future mistress of Alexander, who resided at the Macedonian court from 352 to 342 BC, as well as Amminapes , future satrap of Alexander, or a Persian nobleman named Sisines .</p>
<h2>Regency and ascent of Macedon</h2>
<p>At the age of 16, Alexander's education under Aristotle ended. 13] During Philip's absence, the Thracian tribe of Maedi revolted against Macedonia. Alexander responded quickly and drove them from their territory. Campaigning against the Greek city of Perinthus , Alexander reportedly saved his father's life. Philip then returned to Elatea, sending a final offer of peace to Athens and Thebes, who both rejected it. [ During the ensuing Battle of Chaeronea , Philip commanded the right wing and Alexander the left, accompanied by a group of Philip's trusted generals. Left to fight alone, they were defeated. [ 35] At Corinth , Philip established a "Hellenic Alliance" (modelled on the old anti-Persian alliance of the Greco-Persian Wars ), which included most Greek city-states except Sparta.</p>
<h2>Exile and return</h2>
<p>When Philip returned to Pella, he fell in love with and married Cleopatra Eurydice in 338 BC, [38] the niece of his general Attalus . [ 40] During the wedding banquet , a drunken Attalus publicly prayed to the gods that the union would produce a legitimate heir. [ 39] At the wedding of Cleopatra, whom Philip fell in love with and married, she being much too young for him, her uncle Attalus in his drink desired the Macedonians would implore the gods to give them a lawful successor to the kingdom by his niece. This so irritated Alexander, that throwing one of the cups at his head, "You villain," said he, "what, am I then a bastard?" At which Alexander reproachfully insulted over him: "See there," said he, "the man who makes preparations to pass out of Europe into Asia, overturned in passing from one seat to another." In 337 BC, Alexander fled Macedon with his mother, dropping her off with her brother, King Alexander I of Epirus in Dodona , capital of the Molossians . [ 44] In the following year, the Persian satrap (governor) of Caria , Pixodarus , offered his eldest daughter to Alexander's half-brother, Philip Arrhidaeus . [ When Philip heard of this, he stopped the negotiations and scolded Alexander for wishing to marry the daughter of a Carian, explaining that he wanted a better bride for him.</p>
<h2>Accession</h2>
<p>In summer 336 BC, while at Aegae attending the wedding of his daughter Cleopatra to Olympias's brother, Alexander I of Epirus, Philip was assassinated by the captain of his bodyguards , Pausanias . [ e] As Pausanias tried to escape, he tripped over a vine and was killed by his pursuers, including two of Alexander's companions, Perdiccas and Leonnatus . Alexander was proclaimed king on the spot by the nobles and army at the age of 20.</p>
<h2>Consolidation of power</h2>
<p>Alexander began his reign by eliminating potential rivals to the throne. He had his cousin, the former Amyntas IV , executed. [ 50] He also had two Macedonian princes from the region of Lyncestis killed for having been involved in his father's assassination, but spared a third, Alexander Lyncestes . Olympias had Cleopatra Eurydice, and Europa, her daughter by Philip, burned alive. When Alexander learned about this, he was furious. 53] Alexander stopped at Thermopylae, where he was recognized as the leader of the Amphictyonic League before heading south to Corinth . Athens sued for peace and Alexander pardoned the rebels. He also received news of a Thracian uprising.</p>
<h2>Balkan campaign</h2>
<p>Before crossing to Asia, Alexander wanted to safeguard his northern borders. In the spring of 335 BC, he advanced to suppress several revolts. Starting from Amphipolis , he travelled east into the country of the "Independent Thracians"; and at Mount Haemus , the Macedonian army attacked and defeated the Thracian forces manning the heights. [ Alexander then marched for three days to the Danube , encountering the Getae tribe on the opposite shore. Crossing the river at night, he surprised them and forced their army to retreat after the first cavalry skirmish . [ 59] News then reached Alexander that the Illyrian chieftain Cleitus and King Glaukias of the Taulantii were in open revolt against his authority. Marching west into Illyria, Alexander defeated each in turn, forcing the two rulers to flee with their troops. With these victories, he secured his northern frontier.</p>
<h2>Destruction of Thebes</h2>
<p>While Alexander campaigned north, the Thebans and Athenians rebelled once again. 61] While the other cities again hesitated, Thebes decided to fight. The Theban resistance was ineffective, and Alexander razed the city and divided its territory between the other Boeotian cities. The end of Thebes cowed Athens, leaving all of Greece temporarily at peace. [ 61] Alexander then set out on his Asian campaign, leaving Antipater as regent.</p>
<h2>Asia Minor</h2>
<p>After his victory at the Battle of Chaeronea (338 BC) , Philip II began the work of establishing himself as hēgemṓn ( Greek : ἡγεμών ) of a league which according to Diodorus was to wage a campaign against the Persians for the sundry grievances Greece suffered in 480 and free the Greek cities of the western coast and islands from Achaemenid rule. The Greek cities on the western coast of Anatolia revolted until the news arrived that Philip had been murdered and had been succeeded by his young son Alexander. This also showed Alexander's eagerness to fight, in contrast to his father's preference for diplomacy. [ 61] After an initial victory against Persian forces at the Battle of the Granicus , Alexander accepted the surrender of the Persian provincial capital and treasury of Sardis ; he then proceeded along the Ionian coast, granting autonomy and democracy to the cities. Miletus , held by Achaemenid forces, required a delicate siege operation, with Persian naval forces nearby. 66] Alexander left the government of Caria to a member of the Hecatomnid dynasty, Ada , who adopted Alexander. [ From Pamphylia onwards the coast held no major ports and Alexander moved inland. At Termessos , Alexander humbled but did not storm the Pisidian city.</p>
<h2>The Levant and Syria</h2>
<p>In spring 333 BC, Alexander crossed the Taurus into Cilicia . After a long pause due to an illness, he marched on towards Syria. Though outmanoeuvered by Darius's significantly larger army, he marched back to Cilicia, where he defeated Darius at Issus . Darius fled the battle, causing his army to collapse, and left behind his wife, his two daughters, his mother Sisygambis , and a fabulous treasure. [ 71] He offered a peace treaty that included the lands he had already lost, and a ransom of 10,000 talents for his family. Alexander replied that since he was now king of Asia, it was he alone who decided territorial divisions. [ 72] Alexander proceeded to take possession of Syria , and most of the coast of the Levant . [ 73] [74] The men of military age were massacred and the women and children sold into slavery .</p>
<h2>Egypt</h2>
<p>When Alexander destroyed Tyre, most of the towns on the route to Egypt quickly capitulated. The stronghold was heavily fortified and built on a hill, requiring a siege. When "his engineers pointed out to him that because of the height of the mound it would be impossible... this encouraged Alexander all the more to make the attempt". [ As in Tyre, men of military age were put to the sword and the women and children were sold into slavery. [ In the temple of Luxor, near Karnak, he built a chapel for the sacred barge. 78] He was pronounced son of the deity Amun at the Oracle of Siwa Oasis in the Libyan desert. [ 80] Henceforth, Alexander often referred to Zeus-Ammon as his true father, and after his death, currency depicted him adorned with the Horns of Ammon as a symbol of his divinity. [ 78] During his stay in Egypt, he founded Alexandria , which would become the prosperous capital of the Ptolemaic Kingdom after his death.</p>
<h2>Assyria and Babylonia</h2>
<p>Leaving Egypt in 331 BC, Alexander marched eastward into Achaemenid Assyria in Upper Mesopotamia (now northern Iraq ) and defeated Darius again at the Battle of Gaugamela . [ 83] Darius once more fled the field, and Alexander chased him as far as Arbela . Gaugamela would be the final and decisive encounter between the two. [ 84] Darius fled over the mountains to Ecbatana (modern Hamadan ) while Alexander captured Babylon . [ 85] Babylonian astronomical diaries say that "the king of the world, Alexander" sent his scouts with a message to the people of Babylon before entering the city: "I shall not enter your houses".</p>
<h2>Persia</h2>
<p>From Babylon, Alexander went to Susa , one of the Achaemenid capitals, and captured its treasury. [ 85] He sent the bulk of his army to the Persian ceremonial capital of Persepolis via the Persian Royal Road . Alexander himself took selected troops on the direct route to the city. 87] On entering Persepolis, Alexander allowed his troops to loot the city for several days. [ 88] Alexander stayed in Persepolis for five months. [ 89] During his stay a fire broke out in the eastern palace of Xerxes I and spread to the rest of the city. Possible causes include a drunken accident or deliberate revenge for the burning of the Acropolis of Athens during the Second Persian War by Xerxes; [90] Plutarch and Diodorus allege that Alexander's companion, the hetaera Thaïs , instigated and started the fire. Even as he watched the city burn, Alexander immediately began to regret his decision.</p>
<h2>Fall of the Persian Empire and the East</h2>
<p>Alexander then chased Darius, first into Media, and then Parthia. [ 97] As Alexander approached, Bessus had his men fatally stab the Great King and then declared himself Darius's successor as Artaxerxes V, before retreating into Central Asia to launch a guerrilla campaign against Alexander. [ 98] Alexander buried Darius's remains next to his Achaemenid predecessors in a regal funeral. [ 102] Alexander viewed Bessus as a usurper and set out to defeat him. This campaign, initially against Bessus, turned into a grand tour of central Asia. Alexander founded a series of new cities, all called Alexandria, including modern Kandahar in Afghanistan, and Alexandria Eschate ("The Furthest") in modern Tajikistan . 103] In 329 BC, Spitamenes , who held an undefined position in the satrapy of Sogdiana, betrayed Bessus to Ptolemy , one of Alexander's trusted companions, and Bessus was executed. [ After the defeat, Spitamenes was killed by his own men, who then sued for peace.</p>
<h2>Problems and plots</h2>
<p>During this time, Alexander adopted some elements of Persian dress and customs at his court, notably the custom of proskynesis , either a symbolic kissing of the hand, or prostration on the ground, that Persians showed to their social superiors. [ 106] This was one aspect of Alexander's broad strategy aimed at securing the aid and support of the Iranian upper classes. [ 102] The Greeks however regarded the gesture of proskynesis as the province of deities and believed that Alexander meant to deify himself by requiring it. This cost him the sympathies of many of his countrymen, and he eventually abandoned it. [ 102] The latter were in many cases additionally connected through marriage alliances with the royal Achaemenid family. [ 102] However, Alexander's eventual decision to burn the Achaemenid palace at Persepolis in conjunction with the major rejection and opposition of the "entire Persian people" made it impracticable for him to pose himself as Darius' legitimate successor. [ 102] A plot against his life was revealed, and one of his officers, Philotas , was executed for failing to alert Alexander. Most infamously, Alexander personally killed the man who had saved his life at Granicus, Cleitus the Black , during a violent drunken altercation at Maracanda (modern day Samarkand in Uzbekistan ), in which Cleitus accused Alexander of several judgmental mistakes and most especially, of having forgotten the Macedonian ways in favour of a corrupt oriental lifestyle.</p>
<h2>Macedon in Alexander's absence</h2>
<p>When Alexander set out for Asia, he left his general Antipater , an experienced military and political leader and part of Philip II's "Old Guard", in charge of Macedon. [ 62] Alexander's sacking of Thebes ensured that Greece remained quiet during his absence. [ 62] The one exception was a call to arms by Spartan king Agis III in 331 BC, whom Antipater defeated and killed in the battle of Megalopolis . [ 62] Antipater referred the Spartans' punishment to the League of Corinth, which then deferred to Alexander, who chose to pardon them. [ 111] There was also considerable friction between Antipater and Olympias, and each complained to Alexander about the other. [ 112] In general, Greece enjoyed a period of peace and prosperity during Alexander's campaign in Asia. [ 113] Alexander sent back vast sums from his conquest, which stimulated the economy and increased trade across his empire. [ 114] However, Alexander's constant demands for troops and the migration of Macedonians throughout his empire depleted Macedon's strength, greatly weakening it in the years after Alexander, and ultimately led to its subjugation by Rome after the Third Macedonian War (171–168 BC).</p>
<h2>Coinage</h2>
<p>The conquest by Philip II of Pangaeum and then of the island of Thasos between 356 and 342 BC brought rich gold and silver mines under Macedonian control. [ 116] Alexander minted gold staters , silver tetradrachms and drachims , and various fractional bronze coins. The types of these coins remained constant in his empire. The gold series had the head of Athena on the obverse and a winged Nike (Victory) on the reverse. [ 118] There are both Greek and non-Greek aspects to this design. 116] However, the lion was also the symbolic animal of the Anatolian god Sandas , worshipped at Tarsus . [ 116] The reverse design of Alexander's tetradrachms is closely modelled on the depiction of the god Baaltars (Baal of Tarsus), on the silver staters minted at Tarsus by the Persian satrap Mazaeus before Alexander's conquest. [ Persian coins continued to circulate in all the satrapies of the empire.</p>
<h2>Forays into the Indian subcontinent</h2>
<p>After the death of Spitamenes and his marriage to Roxana (Raoxshna in Old Iranian ) to cement relations with his new satrapies, Alexander turned to the Indian subcontinent . 120] Ambhi hastened to relieve Alexander of his apprehension and met him with valuable presents, placing himself and all his forces at his disposal. In the winter of 327/326 BC, Alexander personally led a campaign against the Aspasioi of the Kunar Valley , the Guraeans of the Guraeus Valley , and the Assakenoi of the Swat and Buner Valleys . [ 123] A similar slaughter followed at Ora. In the aftermath of Massaga and Ora, numerous Assakenians fled to the fortress of Aornos . 120] After Aornos, Alexander crossed the Indus and fought and won an epic battle against King Porus , who ruled a region lying between the Hydaspes and the Acesines (Chenab), in what is now the Punjab , in the Battle of the Hydaspes in 326 BC. [ 125] [126] Choosing a local helped him control these lands so distant from Greece. [ 127] Alexander founded two cities on opposite sides of the Hydaspes river, naming one Bucephala , in honour of his horse, who died around this time.</p>
<h2>Revolt of the Hellenic army</h2>
<p>East of Porus's kingdom, near the Ganges River , was the Nanda Empire of Magadha , and further east, the Gangaridai Empire of Bengal region of the Indian subcontinent. 131] This river thus marks the easternmost extent of Alexander's conquests. [ 132] As for the Macedonians, however, their struggle with Porus blunted their courage and stayed their further advance into India. For they were told that the kings of the Ganderites and Praesii were awaiting them with eighty thousand horsemen, two hundred thousand footmen, eight thousand chariots, and six thousand war elephants . [ 133] Alexander tried to persuade his soldiers to march farther, but his general Coenus pleaded with him to change his opinion and return; the men, he said, "longed to again see their parents, their wives and children, their homeland". Alexander eventually agreed and turned south, marching along the Indus . 134] [135] Alexander sent much of his army to Carmania (modern southern Iran ) with general Craterus , and commissioned a fleet to explore the Persian Gulf shore under his admiral Nearchus , while he led the rest back to Persia through the more difficult southern route along the Gedrosian Desert and Makran . [ 136] Alexander reached Susa in 324 BC, but not before losing many men to the harsh desert.</p>
<h2>Last years in Persia</h2>
<p>Discovering that many of his satraps and military governors had misbehaved in his absence, Alexander executed several of them as examples on his way to Susa . [ They refused to be sent away and criticized his adoption of Persian customs and dress and the introduction of Persian officers and soldiers into Macedonian units. [ 141] After three days, unable to persuade his men to back down, Alexander gave Persians command posts in the army and conferred Macedonian military titles upon Persian units. The Macedonians quickly begged forgiveness, which Alexander accepted, and held a great banquet with several thousand of his men. [ 144] Afterwards, Alexander travelled to Ecbatana to retrieve the bulk of the Persian treasure. There, his closest friend, Hephaestion, died of illness or poisoning. [ 145] Hephaestion's death devastated Alexander and he ordered the preparation of an expensive funeral pyre in Babylon along with a decree for public mourning. [ There is a tradition that they would only start serious drinking after everyone was done with their meals, but the wine was usually heavily watered.</p>
<h2>Death and succession</h2>
<p>Before his death, someone asked Alexander on who would be his designated successor should he die, he responded: "To the strongest one." Plutarch's account is that roughly 14 days before his death, Alexander entertained admiral Nearchus and spent the night and next day drinking with Medius of Larissa . [ 151] Alexander developed a fever, which worsened until he was unable to speak. 153] Arrian also mentioned this as an alternative, but Plutarch specifically denied this claim. [ 153] [156] The accounts were nevertheless fairly consistent in designating Antipater , recently removed as Macedonian viceroy, replaced by Craterus, as the head of the alleged plot. [ 157] Perhaps taking his summons to Babylon as a death sentence [158] and having seen the fate of Parmenion and Philotas, [159] Antipater purportedly arranged for Alexander to be poisoned by his son Iollas, who was Alexander's wine-pourer. [ 156] [159] There was even a suggestion that Aristotle may have participated. [ The anguish that Alexander felt after Hephaestion's death may also have contributed to his declining health.</p>
<h2>Post-death events</h2>
<p>Alexander's body was laid in a gold anthropoid sarcophagus that was filled with honey, which was in turn placed in a gold casket. [ Ptolemy IX Lathyros , one of Ptolemy's final successors, replaced Alexander's sarcophagus with a glass one so he could convert the original to coinage. [ This would fit with the intended destination of Alexander's funeral cortege. Around AD 200, Emperor Septimius Severus closed Alexander's tomb to the public. His son and successor, Caracalla , a great admirer, visited the tomb during his own reign. It was originally thought to have been the sarcophagus of Abdalonymus (died 311 BC), the king of Sidon appointed by Alexander immediately following the battle of Issus in 331. [ 180] [181] However, more recently, it has been suggested that it may date from earlier than Abdalonymus's death. [ 182] Demades likened the Macedonian army, after the death of Alexander, to the blinded Cyclops , due to the many random and disorderly movements that it made.</p>
<h2>Division of the Macedonian Empire</h2>
<p>Alexander's death was so sudden that when reports of his death reached Greece, they were not immediately believed. [ 62] Alexander had no obvious or legitimate heir, his son Alexander IV by Roxane being born after Alexander's death. [ 153] Another theory is that his successors wilfully or erroneously misheard "tôi Kraterôi"—"to Craterus", the general leading his Macedonian troops home and newly entrusted with the regency of Macedonia. [ 188] Arrian and Plutarch claimed that Alexander was speechless by this point, implying that this was an apocryphal story. [ However, the infantry, under the command of Meleager , rejected this arrangement since they had been excluded from the discussion. Instead, they supported Alexander's half-brother Philip Arrhidaeus. 190] Dissension and rivalry soon affected the Macedonians, however. In the process, both Alexander IV and Philip III were murdered.</p>
<h2>Last plans</h2>
<p>Diodorus stated that Alexander had given detailed written instructions to Craterus some time before his death, which are known as Alexander's "last plans". [ 193] Craterus started to carry out Alexander's commands, but the successors chose not to further implement them, on the grounds they were impractical and extravagant. [ 193] Furthermore, Perdiccas had read the notebooks containing Alexander's last plans to the Macedonian troops in Babylon, who voted not to carry them out. [ 62] According to Diodorus, Alexander's last plans called for military expansion into the southern and western Mediterranean, monumental constructions, and the intermixing of Eastern and Western populations. Ernst Badian argued that they were exaggerated by Perdiccas in order to ensure that the Macedonian troops voted not to carry them out. [ 194] Other scholars have proposed that they were invented by later authors within the tradition of the Alexander Romance .</p>
<h2>Generalship</h2>
<p>Alexander perhaps earned the epithet "the Great" due to his unparalleled success as a military commander; he never lost a battle, despite typically being outnumbered. [ 197] This was due to use of terrain, phalanx and cavalry tactics, bold strategy, and the fierce loyalty of his troops. [ 198] In his first battle in Asia, at Granicus, Alexander used only a small part of his forces, perhaps 13,000 infantry with 5,000 cavalry, against a much larger Persian force of 40,000. [ By contrast, the Persian infantry was stationed behind its cavalry. 202] At the decisive encounter with Darius at Gaugamela, Darius equipped his chariots with scythes on the wheels to break up the phalanx and equipped his cavalry with pikes. The advance was successful and broke Darius's center, causing the latter to flee once again. [ 201] When faced with opponents who used unfamiliar fighting techniques, such as in Central Asia and India, Alexander adapted his forces to his opponents' style. Thus, in Bactria and Sogdiana , Alexander successfully used his javelin throwers and archers to prevent outflanking movements, while massing his cavalry at the center.</p>
<h2>Physical appearance</h2>
<p>Historical sources frequently give conflicting accounts of Alexander's appearance, and the earliest sources are the most scant in their detail. [ This included commissioning sculptures by Lysippos , paintings by Apelles and gem engravings by Pyrgoteles . [ Therefore, since his feet did not reach its lowest step, one of the royal pages placed a table under his feet. [ 208] Both Curtius and Diodorus report a story that when Darius III 's mother, Sisygambis , first met Alexander and Hephaestion , she assumed that the latter was Alexander because he was the taller and more handsome of the two. [ 209] The Greek biographer Plutarch ( c. 45 – c. 120 AD ) discusses the accuracy of his depictions: The outward appearance of Alexander is best represented by the statues of him which Lysippus made, and it was by this artist alone that Alexander himself thought it fit that he should be modelled. Apelles, however, in painting him as wielder of the thunder-bolt, did not reproduce his complexion, but made it too dark and swarthy. 204] The Alexander Mosaic and contemporary coins portray Alexander with "a straight nose, a slightly protruding jaw, full lips and eyes deep set beneath a strongly pronounced forehead". [ 204] He is also described as having a slight upward tilt of his head to the left.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Both of Alexander's parents encouraged his ambitions. 218] Alexander's mother Olympia similarly had huge ambitions, and encouraged her son to believe it was his destiny to conquer the Persian Empire. [ He had a great desire for knowledge, a love for philosophy, and was an avid reader. [ 226] He had great charisma and force of personality, characteristics which made him a great leader. [ 230] [231] He appears to have believed himself a deity, or at least sought to deify himself. [ 158] Olympias always insisted to him that he was the son of Zeus, [232] a theory apparently confirmed to him by the oracle of Amun at Siwa . [ 233] Alexander adopted elements of Persian dress and customs at court, notably proskynesis , which was one aspect of Alexander's broad strategy aimed at securing the aid and support of the Iranian upper classes; [102] however the practise of proskynesis was disapproved by the Macedonians, and they were unwilling to perform it. [ 106] This behaviour cost him the sympathies of many of his countrymen.</p>
<h2>Personal relationships</h2>
<p>Alexander married three times: Roxana , daughter of the Sogdian nobleman Oxyartes of Bactria , [237] [238] [239] out of love; [240] and the Persian princesses Stateira and Parysatis , the former a daughter of Darius III and the latter a daughter of Artaxerxes III , for political reasons. [ 241] [242] He apparently had two sons, Alexander IV of Macedon by Roxana and, possibly, Heracles of Macedon from his mistress Barsine . He lost another child when Roxana miscarried at Babylon. [ 145] [246] This event may have contributed to Alexander's failing health and detached mental state during his final months. [ 248] This episode is also told by Plutarch, probably based on the same source. 249] Some modern historians (e.g., Robin Lane Fox ) believe not only that Alexander's youthful relationship with Hephaestion was sexual, but that their sexual contacts may have continued into adulthood, which went against the social norms of at least some Greek cities, such as Athens, [250] [251] though some modern researchers have tentatively proposed that Macedonia (or at least the Macedonian court) may have been more tolerant of homosexuality between adults. [ 218] However, Ogden calculates that Alexander, who impregnated his partners thrice in eight years, had a higher matrimonial record than his father at the same age. [ 256] Green suggested that, in the context of the period, Alexander formed quite strong friendships with women, including Ada of Caria , who adopted him, and even Darius's mother Sisygambis , who supposedly died from grief upon hearing of Alexander's death.</p>
<h2>Legacy</h2>
<p>Alexander's legacy extended beyond his military conquests, and his reign marked a turning point in European and Asian history. [ 258] His campaigns greatly increased contacts and trade between East and West , and vast areas to the east were significantly exposed to Greek civilization and influence. [ 17] Some of the cities he founded became major cultural centers, many surviving into the 21st century. His chroniclers recorded valuable information about the areas through which he marched, while the Greeks themselves got a sense of belonging to a world beyond the Mediterranean.</p>
<h2>Hellenistic kingdoms</h2>
<p>Alexander's most immediate legacy was the introduction of Macedonian rule to huge new swathes of Asia. At the time of his death, Alexander's empire covered some 5,200,000 km 2 (2,000,000 sq mi), [259] and was the largest state of its time. Many of these areas remained in Macedonian hands or under Greek influence for the next 200–300 years. The successor states that emerged were, at least initially, dominant forces, and these 300 years are often referred to as the Hellenistic period . [ 260] The eastern borders of Alexander's empire began to collapse even during his lifetime. [ 187] However, the power vacuum he left in the northwest of the Indian subcontinent directly gave rise to one of the most powerful Indian dynasties in history, the Maurya Empire . Taking advantage of this power vacuum, Chandragupta Maurya (referred to in Greek sources as "Sandrokottos"), of relatively humble origin, took control of the Punjab , and with that power base proceeded to conquer the Nanda Empire .</p>
<h2>Founding of cities</h2>
<p>Over the course of his conquests, Alexander founded some twenty cities that bore his name , most of them east of the Tigris . [ 107] The cities' locations reflected trade routes as well as defensive positions. At first, the cities must have been inhospitable, little more than defensive garrisons. [ 107] Following Alexander's death, many Greeks who had settled there tried to return to Greece. [ 107] The foundation of the "new" Smyrna was also associated with Alexander. According to the legend, after Alexander hunted on the Mount Pagus , he slept under a plane tree at the sanctuary of Nemesis . While he was sleeping, the goddess appeared and told him to found a city there and move into it the Smyrnaeans from the "old" city. 263] The city of Pella , in modern Jordan , was founded by veterans of Alexander's army, and named it after the city of Pella , in Greece, which was the birthplace of Alexander.</p>
<h2>Funding of temples</h2>
<p>In 334 BC, Alexander the Great donated funds for the completion of the new temple of Athena Polias in Priene , in modern-day western Turkey. [ 266] An inscription from the temple , now housed in the British Museum , declares: "King Alexander dedicated [this temple] to Athena Polias." [ 265] This inscription is one of the few independent archaeological discoveries confirming an episode from Alexander's life. [ 265] The temple was designed by Pytheos , one of the architects of the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus . [ 265] [266] [267] Libanius wrote that Alexander founded the temple of Zeus Bottiaios ( Ancient Greek : Βοττιαίου Δῖός ), in the place where later the city of Antioch was built. [ 268] [269] Suda wrote that Alexander built a big temple to Sarapis .</p>
<h2>Hellenization</h2>
<p>Hellenization was coined by the German historian Johann Gustav Droysen to denote the spread of Greek language, culture, and population into the former Persian empire after Alexander's conquest. [ 272] Alexander sought to insert Greek elements into Persian culture and to hybridize Greek and Persian culture, homogenizing the populations of Asia and Europe. Although his successors explicitly rejected such policies, Hellenization occurred throughout the region, accompanied by a distinct and opposite 'Orientalization' of the successor states. [ 273] The core of the Hellenistic culture promulgated by the conquests was essentially Athenian . [ 274] The close association of men from across Greece in Alexander's army directly led to the emergence of the largely Attic -based " koine ", or "common" Greek dialect. [ 275] Furthermore, town planning , education, local government, and art current in the Hellenistic period were all based on Classical Greek ideals, evolving into distinct new forms commonly grouped as Hellenistic. Also, the New Testament was written in the Koine Greek language. [ 271] Aspects of Hellenistic culture were still evident in the traditions of the Byzantine Empire in the mid-15th century.</p>
<h2>Hellenization in South and Central Asia</h2>
<p>Some of the most pronounced effects of Hellenization can be seen in Afghanistan and India, in the region of the relatively late-rising Greco-Bactrian Kingdom (250–125 BC) (in modern Afghanistan , Pakistan , and Tajikistan ) and the Indo-Greek Kingdom (180 BC – 10 AD) in modern Afghanistan and India. [ 278] The resulting syncretism known as Greco-Buddhism influenced the development of Buddhism [279] and created a culture of Greco-Buddhist art . 280] Several Buddhist traditions may have been influenced by the ancient Greek religion : the concept of Boddhisatvas is reminiscent of Greek divine heroes, [281] and some Mahayana ceremonial practices (burning incense , gifts of flowers, and food placed on altars) are similar to those practised by the ancient Greeks; however, similar practices were also observed amongst the native Indic culture. One Greek king, Menander I , probably became Buddhist, and was immortalized in Buddhist literature as 'Milinda'. [ 280] The process of Hellenization also spurred trade between the east and west. [ 282] For example, Greek astronomical instruments dating to the 3rd century BC were found in the Greco-Bactrian city of Ai Khanoum in modern-day Afghanistan , [283] while the Greek concept of a spherical Earth surrounded by the spheres of planets eventually supplanted the long-standing Indian cosmological belief of a disc consisting of four continents grouped around a central mountain (Mount Meru) like the petals of a flower. [ In the area of architecture , a few examples of the Ionic order can be found as far as Pakistan with the Jandial temple near Taxila . Several examples of capitals displaying Ionic influences can be seen as far as Patna , especially with the Pataliputra capital , dated to the 3rd century BC.</p>
<h2>Influence on Rome</h2>
<p>Alexander and his exploits were admired by many Romans, especially generals, who wanted to associate themselves with his achievements. [ 287] Polybius began his Histories by reminding Romans of Alexander's achievements, and thereafter Roman leaders saw him as a role model. 287] Julius Caesar dedicated a Lysippean equestrian bronze statue but replaced Alexander's head with his own, while Octavian visited Alexander's tomb in Alexandria and temporarily changed his seal from a sphinx to Alexander's profile. [ 293] After Caracalla concluded his campaign against the Alamanni, it became evident that he was inordinately preoccupied with Alexander the Great. [ 294] [295] He began openly mimicking Alexander in his personal style. This was a sign of Caracalla's increasingly erratic behaviour. But this mania for Alexander, strange as it was, was overshadowed by subsequent events in Alexandria. [ 298] Caligula, who could not swim, [299] then proceeded to ride his favourite horse Incitatus across, wearing the breastplate of Alexander the Great .</p>
<h2>Letters</h2>
<p>Alexander wrote and received numerous letters, but no originals survive. A few official letters addressed to the Greek cities survive in copies inscribed in stone and the content of others is sometimes reported in historical sources. These only occasionally quote the letters and it is an open question how reliable such quotations are. Several fictitious letters, some perhaps based on actual letters, made their way into the Romance tradition.</p>
<h2>In legend</h2>
<p>Many of the legends about Alexander derive from his own lifetime, probably encouraged by Alexander himself. [ 302] His court historian Callisthenes portrayed the sea in Cilicia as drawing back from him in proskynesis. Writing shortly after Alexander's death, Onesicritus invented a tryst between Alexander and Thalestris , queen of the mythical Amazons . He reportedly read this passage to his patron King Lysimachus , who had been one of Alexander's generals and who quipped, "I wonder where I was at the time." [ 303] In the first centuries after Alexander's death, probably in Alexandria, a quantity of the legendary material coalesced into a text known as the Alexander Romance , later falsely ascribed to Callisthenes and therefore known as Pseudo-Callisthenes . This text underwent numerous expansions and revisions throughout Antiquity and the Middle Ages , [304] containing many dubious stories, [302] and was translated into numerous languages, [305] for example Middle Persian , Syriac and probably Arabic .</p>
<h2>In ancient and modern culture</h2>
<p>Alexander the Great's accomplishments and legacy have been depicted in many cultures. 305] Alexander features prominently in modern Greek folklore, more so than any other ancient figure. [ 309] Firdausi 's Shahnameh ("The Book of Kings") includes Alexander in a line of legitimate Persian shahs , a mythical figure who explored the far reaches of the world in search of the Fountain of Youth . [ 314] The Syriac version of the Alexander Romance portrays him as an ideal Christian world conqueror who prayed to "the one true God". [ This is cited as a reason for sparing Jerusalem. [ In addition to speech works, sculptures and paintings, in modern times Alexander is still the subject of musical and cinematic works. Newer novels about Alexander are: The trilogy "Alexander the Great" by Valerio Massimo Manfredi consisting of "The son of the dream", "The sand of Amon", and "The ends of the world". The trilogy of Mary Renault consisting of " Fire from Heaven ", " The Persian Boy " and " Funeral Games ".</p>
<h2>Historiography</h2>
<p>Apart from a few inscriptions and fragments, texts written by people who actually knew Alexander or who gathered information from men who served with Alexander were all lost. [ 17] Contemporaries who wrote accounts of his life included Alexander's campaign historian Callisthenes; Alexander's generals Ptolemy and Nearchus ; Aristobulus , a junior officer on the campaigns; and Onesicritus, Alexander's chief helmsman. Their works are lost, but later works based on these original sources have survived. The earliest of these is Diodorus Siculus (1st century BC), followed by Quintus Curtius Rufus (mid-to-late 1st century AD), Arrian (1st to 2nd century AD), the biographer Plutarch (1st to 2nd century AD), and finally Justin , whose work dated as late as the 4th century. [ 17] Of these, Arrian is generally considered the most reliable, given that he used Ptolemy and Aristobulus as his sources, closely followed by Diodorus.</p>
